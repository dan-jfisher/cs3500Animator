Some tests to make:

    Check for errors/invalid throws:
        - negative and 0 frameRate
        - invalid filename for setFileName in ViewSVG
        *********NOTE**************************************************************
        MAY BE ERROR IN setFileName in ViewSVG FUNCTION WHEN CHECKING FOR FILE;
        CODE CURRENTLY SETS THIS.FILENAME = FILENAME IF FILENAME EQUALS NULL OR ""
        SHOULD BE THROWS ILLEGAL ARGUMENT WHEN THAT HAPPENS I THINK
        ***************************************************************************
        - Same change overlapping in time period should throw an error. Check for each type
        of change.
        - SetShapes should throw error when given null list.

    For both views:
       - Test each possible change and what way those changes work (i.e. scale bigger and scale
       smaller)
       - Test that consecutive changes work (more than one test; different combinations of changes)
       - different frame rates result in different time in seconds for each animation

    ViewSVG:
    - Draw shapes at negative positions (shouldn't throw error, but shouldn't be on screen)
    - GetRectangleDescription()
    - GetEllipseDescription

    ViewText:
    - Display() function prints out all shapes in animation, not just the visible ones.
    (maybe make a shape that never appears and see if it still prints?)
