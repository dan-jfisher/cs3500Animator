The following changes were made to our code from the previous assignment:
    - Added functions of all views to IView and make unsupported functions throw
    UnsupportedOperationException's.
    - Changed model to store shapes in LinkedHashMap rather than HashMap since draw order
    wasn't conserved in HashMap.
    - set the Timer to be a member variable of ViewGUI so that it can be seen by classes that
        extend it.
    - Added more IllegalArgumentExceptions where applicable.

The following classes were added:
    - InteractiveViewGUI - GUI class that has features that end-user can adjust on screen.
    - HybridController - Controller which works for both interactive gui and text views.
    - InteractiveController - Controller which works with interactive views for
    interactive animations. Extends from ControllerGUI and implements IListener.
    - IListener - Interface whose objects listens for actions to which they react.

Other changes that were made:
    - Added looping functionality to ViewGUI
