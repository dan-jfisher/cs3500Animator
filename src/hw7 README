The following changes were made to our code from the previous assignment:
    - Added functions of all views to IView and make unsupported functions throw
    UnsupportedOperationException's.
    - Changed model to store shapes in LinkedHashMap rather than HashMap since draw order
    wasn't conserved in HashMap.


The following classes were added:
    -IGuiBasedView
    -InteractiveViewGUI
    -HybridController
    -InteractiveController
