The following changes were made to our code from the previous assignment:
    - Added functions of all views to IView and make unsupported functions throw
    UnsupportedOperationException's.
    - Changed model to store shapes in LinkedHashMap rather than HashMap since draw order
    wasn't conserved in HashMap.


The following classes were added:
    - IGuiBasedView
    - InteractiveViewGUI
    - HybridController
    - InteractiveController
    - Added looping functionality to ViewGUI
    - set the Timer to be a member variable of ViewGUI so that it can be seen by classes that
    extend it
