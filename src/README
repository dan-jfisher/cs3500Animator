Most of our new model was adopted from Dan's original model with some minor changes. These
changes include:
    - Changed shapes HashMap to use strings as the key rather than an int. This is the proper
    way to ID shapes.
    - Adopted shapeType from Kevin's model to label each shape object as a shape.
    This lets controller determine what kind of shape it is working with so it knows which
    geometry shape to create as a result.
